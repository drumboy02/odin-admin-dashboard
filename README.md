TOP: Admin Dashboard Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

This project was a full dashboard design using CSS grid for the majority of the work.

The goal was to match the layout in the example dashboard-project.png as close as possible.
It's a little bit off, I did not intend for the page to scroll vertically but I kind of liked the way it looked. Hover effects were added to the links and the buttons for fun.
